Bayesian Neural Networks
========================
 
This goal of this project is to allow experimentation with different neural network structures
and variations on the MCMC sampling procedure.

# Usage

The [RUN.sh Script](Run.sh) gives examples of how to execute several network architectures on a
range of datasets.
